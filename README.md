# ADePTR
Acoustic Detection Processing and Visualization Tool in R

## To install:
`devtools::install_github("bsmity13/ADePTR", build_vignettes = TRUE)`

*Note:* The vignette is quite large and may take a few (or several) minutes to build. If you don't need it, you can skip that option, but we highly recommend you view it at some point to understand the intended workflow.

## To get started:  
*  Load the package with `library(ADePTR)`
*  See the help file with `?ADePTR`
*  Work through the vignette with `vignette("adeptr")`
